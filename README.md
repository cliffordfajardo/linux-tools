# linux-tools
My own versions of GNU coreutils programs plus a few others, written for fun and profit as I learn about Linux system programming.

# Building
Just `make` any file you see here, or `make all`.

## The programs
All programs I haven't implemented yet are listed in `TODO.md`. Currently implemented are:

 - [X] `cat` - `concatenate files and print on the standard output`
  - [ ] all flags implemented
  - [ ] tests implemented
 - [X] `echo` - `display a line of text`
  - [ ] all flags implemented
  - [ ] tests implemented
